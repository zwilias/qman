## Core features

- Sane defaults, highly extensible and configurable
- Allows effortless reserving from a connection pool
- Supports graceful shutdown upon receiving a signal
- Protects job-execution from unexpected intrusions
- Extensible job-failure handling
- Built-in support for fine-grained PSR-3 logging
- Built-in support for queueing closures

## Requirements

- PHP 5.5, PHP 5.6. [`ev`](https://pecl.php.net/package/ev) does not support PHP 7 yet.
- the pcntl extension.
- [`ev`](https://pecl.php.net/package/ev), an interface to libev, the high performance full-featured event-loop.
- one or more instances of beanstalkd.

## Use case

QMan is optimized for multiple beanstalkd instances and a pool of workers listening to all of those.

## Examples

### Queueing a closure

Queueing a closure is quite possibly the easiest thing 

```php
use QMan\QMan;

$qMan = QMan::create(['localhost:11300']);
$qMan->queueClosure(function () {
    echo 'Hello world!';
});
```

Essentially, this is equivalent to the following:

```php
use QMan\QMan;
use QMan\ClosureCommand;

$qMan = QMan::create(['localhost:11300']);
$qMan->queue(ClosureCommand::create(function () {
    echo 'Hello world!';
}));
```

### Working the queue

Starting a worker with all the defaults injected, is easy:

```php
use Beanie\Beanie;
use QMan\WorkerBuilder;

$beanie = Beanie::pool(['localhost:11300']);
$worker = (new WorkerBuilder())
    ->build($beanie);
    
$worker->run();
```

The `WorkerBuilder` ensures the `QMan\Worker` is setup with all of its required dependencies and configuration.

### Queueing custom commands

The `ClosureCommand`, while convenient, comes with two major downsides:

- Serializing closures is rather expensive, in terms of computational power required
- Unit-testing closures quickly devolves into a huge mess

As such, you'll quickly be writing custom commands on a regular basis.

A command should implement `QMan\CommandInterface`, which is easily done through extending `QMan\AbstractCommand`:

```php
use QMan\AbstractCommand;

class CustomCommand extends AbstractCommand
{
    public function getType()
    {
        return 'my.custom.command';
    }
    
    public function execute()
    {
        echo $this->getData() * 5;
        return true;
    }
}
```

The `getType()` function should return a string which can be uniquely mapped to the class you want to execute. This
indirection is required in order to safely handle picking up stuff like renamed classes through a simple restart of the
worker.

In order for the QMan worker to pick up and execute your command, you'll need to make sure the instance of
`CommandSerializerInterface` will pick it up. QMan comes with a generic implementation of this interface, aptly named
`GenericCommandSerializer`. Let's make sure the class we created above is properly registered:

```php
use Beanie\Beanie;
use QMan\WorkerBuilder;
use QMan\GenericCommandSerializer;

$serializer = new GenericCommandSerializer();
$serializer->registerCommandType('my.custom.command', CustomCommand::class);

$beanie = Beanie::pool(['localhost:11300']);
$worker = (new WorkerBuilder())
    ->withCommandSerializer($serializer)
    ->build($beanie);
    
$worker->run();
```

You could easily futureproof your application by gathering this type <-> class mapping, and representing the types as
constants:

```php
final class Commands
{
    const TYPE_CUSTOM_COMMAND = 'my.custom.command';
    
    public static function $map = [
        self::TYPE_CUSTOM_COMMAND => CustomCommand::class
    ];
}
```

QMan's `GenericCommandSerializer` comes with a `registerCommandTypes($map)` function which can handle exactly the case
described above.

### Configuration

Each `Worker` receives an instance of `QManConfig`. The following properties are currently included:

| Property              | Default     | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `maxMemoryUsage`      | 20MB        | As soon as your memory usage goes over `maxMemoryUsage`, the worker is killed. |
| `maxTimeAlive`        | 24h         | Your worker will be killed after `maxTimeAlive` passes. Workers are expected to
                                        be run in something like supervisord so they can be automatically restarted.   |
| `terminationSignals`  | `[SIGTERM]` | Upon receiving this signal - while idle - the worker will gracefully shut down.
                                        If the signal is sent while a job is being processed, handling the signal will
                                        be postponed until the job is fully processed.                                 |
| `maxTries`            | 3           |Â The maximal number of times a job can be executed resulting in failure before 
                                        the job is buried. <sup>(1)</sup>                                              |
| `defaultFailureDelay` | 60s         | Every time a job fails, it is released again, with a certain delay. The first
                                        time it is released, the delay will be `defaultFailureDelay`. The second time, 
                                        it will be twice that, etc. <sup>(1)</sup>                                     |

*(1)*: Assuming you're using the default `GenericJobFailureStrategy`. Implementing a custom strategy for handling failed
jobs is, of course, perfectly possible.

Changing configuration is as simple as instantiating `QManConfig`, setting your configuration preferences and passing it
to the `CommandBuilder`:

```php
use QMan\QManConfig;
use QMan\QManBuilder;
use Beanie\Beanie;

$config = new QManConfig();
$config->setTerminationSignals([SIGTERM, SIGQUIT]);

$beanie = Beanie::pool($servers);

$worker = (new WorkerBuilder())
    ->withQManConfig($config)
    ->build($beanie);
```

### Handling failed jobs

By default, qMan will employ a very simple strategy when handling failed jobs:

- a failed job will either be buried or released again
- if a job has failed less than `maxTries` times in a row, it will be released with 
    `(tries in a row) * defaultFailureDelay`
- else, when it has failed `maxTries` times in a row, it will be buried

Overriding this behavior can be done easily by implementing `JobFailureStrategyInterface` (which extends both PSR-3's
`LoggerAwareInterface` and qMan's `ConfigAwareInterface`.

```php
use Psr\Log\LoggerAwareTrait;
use QMan\JobFailureStrategyInterface;
use QMan\Job;
use QMan\ConfigAwareTrait;

class MyCustomJobFailureStrategy implements JobFailureStrategyInterface
{
    use LoggerAwareTrait, ConfigAwareTrait;
    
    public function handleFailedJob(Job $job)
    {
        // Do stuff, like deleting the job after 10 total tries
        $stats = $job->stats();
        
        if ($stats['reserves'] > 10) {
            $this->logger->alert('Deleting job after failing to successfully execute over 10 times', ['job' => $job]);
            $job->delete();
        }
    }
}

use QMan\WorkerBuilder;

$worker = (new WorkerBuilder)->withJobFailureStrategy(new MyCustomJobFailureStrategy())->build([...]);
```
